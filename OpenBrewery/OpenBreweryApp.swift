 I did a lot of back and forth. I started with using this OpenBreweryDB API, then eventually
 got frustrated and decided to just add stuff to the Earthquake app. I was trying to get the map
 working for that and went back to what I had for the Brewery app, taking pieces of code and
 putting it into the Earthquake app, until eventually they were both a mess. So, I decided
 to just go with the Brewery app since that ended up coming together a bit better, but it was
 so awful by that point that I had to make a new project and copy and paste only the code I
 knew was working, then I went from there.
 
 I also ended up setting up a github repo so I could have some practice with that (since
 I've never used it with XCode before, only VSCode).
